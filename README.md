Simple javascript game built with MEAN stack

## Example

http://52.17.173.21:3000

## Setup

Just run `node server.js` and connect to `http://0.0.0.0:3000`. There are also bower and npm packages to install.

`npm install && bower install`

## Todo

This project has no real aims but I will soon be implementing a nicer front-end using Angular, as well as MongoDB to hold all location data.
